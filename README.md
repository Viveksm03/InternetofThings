# Health Monitering Device Using ESP32 
## ABSTRACT

Health monitoring devices are revolutionizing modern healthcare through constant tracking, analysis, and surveillance over a single patient's health characteristics. With functions such as biosensors, wireless communications, and artificial intelligence, these devices monitor parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. They act as preventive healthcare tools by identifying early warning signs of illness and thus lessen the chance of developing complications.
